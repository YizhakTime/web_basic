                    <li>
                        To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;

            Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.
            <p>            Entity names look like this: &entity_name;
            </p>
            <p>            Entity numbers look like this: &#entity_number;
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>A commonly used HTML entity is the non-breaking space: &nbsp; 
            A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.
            Can join 2 words together
        </p>
        <p>Entity names are case-sensitive</p>
        <p>
            A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many math and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard, so to add them, 
            you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference)
        </p>
        <p>
            emojis are chars from UTF-8 set, browser must display page correctly by knowing character set used in page
        </p>
        <p>
            Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using entity numbers:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A is 65
                </li>
                <li>
                    B is 66
                </li>
                <li>
                    C is 67
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>&#128512;</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127
                </li>
                <li>
                    Does not use the characters from 128 to 159
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identical to ANSI and 8859-1 from 160 to 255
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continues from the value 256 to 10 000 characters
                </li>
            </ul>

            Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.
            A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address a document (or other data) on the web.
            A web address like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules:
            scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename
            <br>Explanation:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
                </li>
                <li>
                    prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
                </li>
                <li>
                    domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
                </li>
                <li>
                    port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
                </li>
                <li>
                    path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
                </li>
                <li>
                    filename - defines the name of a document or resource
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. 
                If a URL has characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted.
            </li>
            <li>
                URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.
            </li>
            <li>
                URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.
            </li>
            <li>
                URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.
            </li>
        </ul>
