            A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.
            Some diacritical marks, like grave (  ̀) and acute (  ́) are called accents.
            Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.
