            Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.
            <p>            Entity names look like this: &entity_name;
            </p>
            <p>            Entity numbers look like this: &#entity_number;
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>A commonly used HTML entity is the non-breaking space: &nbsp; 
            A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.
            Can join 2 words together
        </p>
        <p>Entity names are case-sensitive</p>

            Many math and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard, so to add them, 
            you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference)

            Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using entity numbers:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A is 65
                </li>
                <li>
                    B is 66
                </li>
                <li>
                    C is 67
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>&#128512;</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127
                </li>
                <li>
                    Does not use the characters from 128 to 159
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identical to ANSI and 8859-1 from 160 to 255
                </li>
