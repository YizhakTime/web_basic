            Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.
            <p>            Entity names look like this: &entity_name;
            </p>
            <p>            Entity numbers look like this: &#entity_number;
            </p>
        </p>

                </li>

                    B is 66
                </li>
                <li>
                    C is 67
